# First 5 C++ Modules - Codam (42 School)

This repository contains my solutions to the first five modules of the C++ curriculum at Codam (42 School). The modules cover the core concepts of C++ programming and serve as the foundation for future learning in the subject. Each module is designed to develop strong skills in fundamental C++ concepts while adhering to the strict coding standards and guidelines set by Codam.

## Modules Overview

### Module 00 - **C++ Basics**

- Introduction to C++ programming
- Basic syntax, data types, and operators
- Functions and program structure
- File I/O operations

### Module 01 - **Memory Management**

- Understanding memory allocation (heap vs stack)
- Pointer manipulation and dereferencing
- Dynamic memory allocation using `new` and `delete`
- Preventing memory leaks

### Module 02 - **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

- Introduction to classes and objects
- Constructors and destructors
- Member functions and attributes
- Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism

### Module 03 - **Makefiles and Compilation**

- Introduction to the compilation process in C++
- Writing and using Makefiles to automate compilation
- Using flags and debugging tools to manage and optimize code
- Managing project files efficiently

### Module 04 - **Advanced OOP Concepts**

- Operator overloading
- Deep dive into static members and constants
- Introduction to inheritance hierarchies and virtual functions
- Handling dynamic polymorphism

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Filipe-FLima/CPP-00.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the specific module folder:

    ```bash
    cd ex00
    ```

3. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    make
    ```

4. Run the program:

    ```bash
    ./program_name
    ```

## Compilation Guidelines

- **Flags**: All code must be compiled using `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` flags.
- **Standard**: The code must be compatible with `-std=c++98` flag.
- **Makefiles**: All projects should include a properly configured Makefile.

---

## Code Structure

- **ex00**: C++ basics exercises
- **ex01**: Memory management exercises
- **ex02**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) exercises
- **ex03**: Makefile and compilation exercises
- **ex04**: Advanced OOP exercises

Each folder corresponds to one of the first 5 modules, and inside each folder, you will find the necessary `.cpp` and `.hpp` files along with the corresponding Makefiles.
